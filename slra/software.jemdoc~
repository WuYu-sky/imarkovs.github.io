= SLRA: Software for weighted structured low-rank approximation

The package computes locally optimal solutions to low-rank approximation problems 
\[
minimize \ over \widehat D
\]
with the following features:
- mosaic Hankel structure constraint on the approximating matrix,
- weighted 2-norm approximation criterion,
- fixed elements in the approximating matrix,
- missing elements in the data matrix, and
- linear constraints on an approximating matrix's left kernel basis.
For an $m\times n$ data matrix, with $m < n$, the computational complexity of the cost function and derivative evaluation is $O(m^2n)$, so that the package is suitable for applications with $n\gg m$.
