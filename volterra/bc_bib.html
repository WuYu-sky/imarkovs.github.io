  abstract = {We consider the problem of computing the greatest common divisor of a set of univariate polynomials and present applications of this problem in system theory and signal processing. One application is blind system identification: given the responses of a system to unknown inputs, find the system. Assuming that the unknown system is finite impulse response and at least two experiments are done with inputs that have finite support and their Z-transforms have no common factors, the impulse response of the system can be computed up to a scaling factor as the greatest common divisor of the Z-transforms of the outputs. Other applications of greatest common divisor problem in system theory and signal processing are finding the distance of a system to the set of uncontrollable systems and common dynamics estimation in a multi-channel sum-of-exponentials model.},

  abstract = {Structured low-rank approximation is used in model reduction, system identification, and signal processing to find low-complexity models from data. The rank constraint imposes the condition that the approximation has bounded complexity and the optimization criterion aims to find the best match between the data---a trajectory of the system---and the approximation. In some applications, however, the data is sub-sampled from a trajectory, which poses the problem of sparse approximation using the the low-rank prior. This paper considers a modified structured low-rank approximation problem where the observed data is a linear transformation of a system's trajectory with reduced dimension. We reformulate this problem as a structured low-rank approximation with missing data and propose a solution methods based on the variable projections principle. We compare the structured low-rank approximation approach with the classical sparsity inducing method of $\ell_1$-norm regularization. The $\ell_1$-norm regularization method is effective for sum-of-exponentials modeling with a large number of samples, however, it is not suitable for identification of systems with damping.},

  abstract = {In metrology, a given measurement technique has fundamental speed and accuracy limitations imposed by physical laws. Data processing allows us to overcome these limitations by using prior knowledge about the sensor dynamics. The prior knowledge considered in this paper is a model class to which the sensor dynamics belongs. We present methods that are applicable to linear time-invariant processes and are suitable for real-time implementation on a digital signal processor.},
