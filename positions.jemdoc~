= Open positions

The department [http://wwwtw.vub.ac.be/elec/ ELEC] of the [http://www.vub.ac.be/ Vrije Universiteit Brussel], Belgium, offers several funded PhD and postdoc positions in [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-rank_approximation low-rank approximation], focused on numerical methods and applications in signal processing and system identification. 

We are looking for candidates with strong background in numerical linear algebra and optimization. Experience in system theory and system identification is an advantage but is not required. Candidates should have excellent English language skills and working knowledge in numerical computing and software development.

The open positions fit into the following funded research projects:
- [http://slra.github.io/ Structured low-rank approximation: Theory, algorithms, and applications],
- [http://imarkovs.github.io/decouple Decoupling multivariate polynomials in nonlinear system identification],
- [http://homepages.vub.ac.be/~imarkovs/volterra/ Block-oriented nonlinear identification using Volterra series], and
- [https://www.esat.kuleuven.be/stadius/selma/ Structured low-rank matrix and tensor approximation: Numerical optimization-based, algorithms, and applications.]

These projects cover a wide range of applications and theoretical research topics. The specific topics for the PhD/postdoc positions will be adapted to fit the interests of the candidates.

In order to apply, contact [http://homepages.vub.ac.be/~imarkovs/index.html Ivan Markovsky] by [Ivan.Markovsky@vub.ac.be email] with CV.
