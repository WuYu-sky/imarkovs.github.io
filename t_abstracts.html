<blockquote>
Behavioral systems theory decouples the behavior of a system from its representation. A key result is that, under a persistency of excitation condition, the image of a Hankel matrix constructed from the data equals the set of finite-length trajectories of a linear time-variant system. The result is the cornerstone of a recently emerged approach to direct data-driven control. This self-contained tutorial reviews its foundations and shows how they can be leveraged for data-driven control. We present a generic data-driven interpolation / approximation formulation encompassing many well known problem instances, among others finite-horizon data-driven control. We embed this problem formulation into a predictive control setting, robustify it to inexact data by means of regularizations, and apply the resulting methods in the context of power electronics dominated power systems.

<blockquote>
The existing nonparametric frequency response estimation methods suffer from leakage and have limited frequency resolution. Due to the leakage and interpolation errors these methods do not yield the correct result in case of exact data of a linear time-invariant system. Our main contribution is a nonparameteric direct data-driven frequency response estimation method that in case of exact data satisfying standard persistency of excitation condition eliminates the leakage and has infinite frequency resolution. The method is derived in the behavioral setting. It requires solving a system of linear equations and has no hyper-parameters. In case of noisy data, a modification of the method with low-rank approximation result in an effective frequency response estimator.

 Sum-of-exponentials modeling via Hankel low-rank approximation with
  palindromic kernel structure.

<blockquote>
Estimation of a sum-of-damped-exponentials signal from noisy samples of the signal is a classic signal processing problem. It can be solved by maximum likelihood as well as suboptimal subspace methods. In this paper, we consider the related problem of sum-of-exponentials modeling, in which the model is constrained to have no damping. This constraint is difficult to impose in the subspace methods. We develop solution methods using an equivalent Hankel matrix low-rank approximation formulation. A necessary condition for the model to have no damping is that a vector in the kernel of the Hankel matrix has palindromic structure. Imposing this necessary condition in solution methods is trivial. Simulation results show that even for a relatively high noise-to-signal ratios the necessary condition is in fact also sufficient, i.e., the identified model has no dumping. Another contribution of the paper is a method for sum-of-exponentials modeling based on circulant embedding: low-rank approximation of a circulant matrix constructed from the given data. This method imposes the constraint that the model has no damping plus an addition constraint that the model frequencies are on the discrete-Fourier transform's grid.

 Computing the distance to uncontrollability: the SISO case.
 Technical report, Vrije Univ. Brussel, 2014.

<blockquote>
In this paper, the problem of computing the distance from a given linear time-invariant system to the nearest uncontrollable system is posed and solved in the behavioral setting. In the case of a system with two external variables, the problem is restated as a Sylvester structured distance to singularity problem. The structured distance to singularity problem is then solved by integrating a system of ordinary differential equations which describes the gradient associated to the cost functional.
An advantage of the method with respect to other approaches is in its capability to include further constraints. Numerical simulations also show that the method is more robust to the initial approximation than the Newton-type methods.
